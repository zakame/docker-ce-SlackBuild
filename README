docker-ce (Docker Community Edition)
--------------------------------------------------------

(Adapted from SlackBuilds.org and Vincent Batts' original scripts.)

Here's how to install the static release of Docker CE on Slackware.


First, go to the Debian Packages page for docker-ce:

https://download.docker.com/linux/static/stable/x86_64/

Download the .tgz package.


Then, with the .tgz package in the same directory as the
docker-ce.SlackBuild script, run the script as root to convert the .deb
to a Slackware .txz:

./docker-ce.SlackBuild

This will produce a Slackware compatible .txz package.  The exact
version number in the package filename will depend on the version
of qemu-efi found in the .deb package, but it will be something
like:  docker-ce-17.12.0-x86_64-1zakame

You'll find the output package in the /tmp directory.


Then, install the package (again as root):

cd /tmp
upgradepkg --install-new docker-ce-17.12.0-x86_64-1zakame.txz


Enjoy!  :-)
